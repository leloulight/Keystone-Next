# Keystone-Next

Keystone Next was a website which collected information such as homework, timetable, notifications, etc. from my school's web portal periodically a few times an hour. It reformatted the data in to a nicer, easier to understand and faster to find format.

The site is no longer hosted as I have since left the school.
